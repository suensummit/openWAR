Description: This package serves two primary purposes: 1) it facilitates the
    computation of openWAR, a fully open-source implementation of Wins Above
    Replacement (WAR) that could serve as a reference implementation for the
    sabermetric community; and 2) it downloads raw XML files from the MLBAM
    GameDay web application and processes them into play-by-play data in a
    tabular format. This play-by-play information is similar in spirit, though
    not in syntax, to play-by-play data made available by Retrosheet. Those
    interested in the modeling choices that we have made in our computation of
    openWAR should consult our paper on the arXiv on that subject. This
    implementation of openWAR includes functions for constructing interval
    estimates of WAR for each player, as well as comparing openWAR point
    estimates to those of Baseball-Reference.com's rWAR.
